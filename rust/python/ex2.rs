/* A comment, this is so you can read your program later. */
/* 
In Rust there like c/c++ there are two type of comment delimiters:
     For block comments you use '/' followed by a '*' and to close it you do the
     opposite; a '*' followed by a '/'. Comments can all be start with two '/'.
     And will go to the end of the line.

fn main() {
    println("I could have code like this."); // and the commend after it is ignored.

/* 
   You can also use a comment to "disable" or "commend out" a piece of code:
   println("This won't run.");
*/
   println("This will run."); 
}
